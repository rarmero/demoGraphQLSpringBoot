SpringBoot, GraphQL & MongoDB

I found reading about GraphQL:

- [Spring GraphQL](https://spring.io/guides/gs/graphql-server/)
  but the example from Spring is very simple.
- [Tutorial Bezkoder](https://www.bezkoder.com/spring-boot-graphql-mongodb-example-graphql-java/)
 but the example from bezkoder uses com.graphql-java dependency

More info:

- [Spring GraphQL](https://docs.spring.io/spring-graphql/reference/index.html)
- [Graphql](https://graphql.org/)
